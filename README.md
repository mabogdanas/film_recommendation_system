#This project was written as the final project of the course Data Analysis and Data Technologies. The task was to work with a Netflix movie dataset and a user ratings dataset. The first part was the exploratory data analysis, then I consider the content-based recommendation system and the collaborative filtering system, and lastly I evaluated the systems.
